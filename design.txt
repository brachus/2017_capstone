-  Depending on game mode, follow through appropriate processing for given frame, using loaded data, mode/state variables for keeping track of things.
-  If main mode:
	Process each character currently active in roster, step animations, actions, movements, etc.

Game play:

Character spawns at starting point.

Character may move around.

Player can press attack button to execute strike based on selected weapon.

Player can press jump to leap in air, or dodge if directional is pressed.

NPCs (only NPCs for now) may be attacked.

If player is attacked, 2 sec. of invicibility is triggered.

If NPC is defeated, an item may appear in its place after it's dissapeared.  Exp points added to.

Message is triggered with earned exp points, picked up items, level ups, etc.

Emphasis should be put on strong, difficult enemies, with specific attack/evade patterns.

In general, game play overall needs to be simple, responsive, tactile.  Needs to require skill.
